Please implement this in the Arduino controller as soon as possible.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**\nHead to the P.V.T Station to retrieve the code you need.\n(⚠️: KEEP AN EYE ON THE DISTANCE)\n\n```cpp\nif (distance = 15) {\n   Serial.println(\"Color1: ------\");\n   setColor(//color1);\n} \n\nelse if (distance = 35) {\n   Serial.println(\"Color2: -----\");\n   setColor(//color2);\n} \n\nelse if (distance = 50) {\n   Serial.println(\"Color3: -----\");\n   setColor(//color3);\n} \n\nelse {\n   Serial.println(\"Color: Off\");\n   setColor(0, 0, 0);\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the color values need to be determined based on the calibration of the specific sensor unit. The distance values (15, 35, 50) are in centimeters and should not be modified.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about the implementation.\n\nRegards,\n\nDr. Sarah Chen\nR&D Director\nDigital Fortress, Inc.\n\n---\n\n*This information is classified and intended only for authorized project personnel.*"
